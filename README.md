CHM 548 PROGRAMMING HOMEWORK 1

(1) Write a program that solves the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary bound potential using a finite-difference method.

(2) Solve the particle in a box problem numerically with this program and compare the results with the analytical solutions. Plot the wave functions if possible.

(3) Solve the particle in a finite depth well problem. Examine the degree of permeation of wave functions into the wall.

(4) Solve the particle in a box problem with a rectangular barrier in the middle. Observe the tunneling splitting of energies.

(5) Solve the harmonic and Morse oscillator problems. Compute Franck–Condon factors across two (displaced) potentials and simulate a vibrational progression in an electronic absorption spectrum.
